# Sistem Kontrol Buzzer dan LED Berbasis Sensor Jarak dan Button

## Overview
This project implements a control system for a buzzer and LED based on distance sensing and button input. It utilizes an Arduino microcontroller to read data from a distance sensor and control the buzzer and LED accordingly. The system is designed to provide visual and auditory feedback based on the proximity of objects detected by the sensor.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sistem-Kontrol-Buzzer-dan-LED-Berbasis-Sensor-Jarak-dan-Button.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Sistem-Kontrol-Buzzer-dan-LED-Berbasis-Sensor-Jarak-dan-Button
   ```
3. Open the `src/firmware/main.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
5. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage
Once the project is uploaded to the Arduino, the system will:
- Continuously read distance data from the sensor.
- Activate the buzzer and LED based on the distance detected and the state of the button.
- Provide feedback when an object is within a specified range.
