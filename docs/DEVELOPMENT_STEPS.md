# DEVELOPMENT STEPS

## 1. Project Planning
- Defined the project scope and objectives.
- Identified the required components: distance sensor, buzzer, LED, and buttons.
- Assigned roles and responsibilities among group members.

## 2. Research and Design
- Researched suitable distance sensors and their interfacing with Arduino.
- Designed the circuit schematic for connecting the components.
- Created a flowchart to outline the logic for controlling the buzzer and LED based on sensor input.

## 3. Setting Up the Development Environment
- Installed the Arduino IDE for coding and uploading sketches.
- Set up version control using Git and created the initial repository structure.

## 4. Coding
- Developed the main Arduino sketch (`main.ino`) to initialize components and implement the control logic.
- Created the sensor library (`sensor.h`) to encapsulate sensor functionalities.
- Implemented button handling to control the system manually.


## 5. Testing
- Conducted unit tests for individual components (sensor, buzzer, LED).
- Performed integration testing to ensure all components worked together as intended.
- Documented test cases and results in `test_firmware.md`.

## 6. Deployment
- Finalized the code and ensured all components were functioning correctly.
- Prepared documentation for the project, including `README.md`, `MEMBERS.md`, and `INTRODUCTION.md`.

## 7. Review and Feedback
- Conducted a review session with all group members to gather feedback.
- Made necessary adjustments based on feedback received.

## 8. Finalization
- Completed all documentation and ensured the project was ready for presentation.
- Submitted the project for evaluation.
